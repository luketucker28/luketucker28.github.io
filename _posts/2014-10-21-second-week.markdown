The Second Week has come and gone at NSS. I am beginning to feel more confident with
my ability to complete the tasks put before me. Initially, I thought I had gained more
knowledge from the pre-work we had completed. In retrospect, I realize the pace I 
pursued the prework with did not allow me to retain the information. I revisited the 
pre-work over the weekend and felt more at ease this week. Hopefully, that trend continues.
