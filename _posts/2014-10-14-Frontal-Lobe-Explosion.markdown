<h1>My Frontal Lobe Hurts</h1>

<p>I have made it through the first week. Whether I have retained any information or severely damaged
my frontal lobes is irrelevant to that small victory. Before being accepted into NSS I enrolled in 
Lipscomb University’s Certificate of Accounting program to pursue a CPA license. Unfortunately, 
Lipscomb’s finals week overlapped with the NSS first week. The entire week I split my time into 
parallel study tracks, Cost Accounting, Inventory Accounting, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Accumulated 
Depreciation, etc. At one point, I found myself typing accounting jargon into my CSS.</p>

<p>The human brain was not built for weeks like this. At NSS I found myself lagging behind my classmates in 
understanding the topics discussed, and was horrified to realize how little I did actually did known
about programming. That feeling is awful, but it provided a dose of humility that I probably needed to be 
successful going forward. </p>

<p>I am going to get some rest and start fresh. </p>
