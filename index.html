			<h1>About</h1>
				<p> For the past ten years I have served as an upper administrator for multiple social service agencies. I specialized in the support of individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. This career was rewarding and enjoyable but I felt the need to embrace a new challenge in my life.  I enrolled at the Nashville Software School in October 2014 to gain competency as a full-stack web developer. I hope to utilize the skills I gain during this process to become a web developer, and continue to gain skills in a process of life-long learning. Hopefully, this skill set will also enable me to provide support to causes I support</p>
