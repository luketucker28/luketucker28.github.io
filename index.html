<h2 class="bioside biohead">"Hello, World"</h2>
<p class="bioside">I am proud to be a member of the March 2015 Nashville Software Schools seventh
  graduating class. After a long career in social services administration, I decided to transition
  my career path in 2014. I was lucky enough to have heard about NSS through a neighbor, and to have a wife whose
  continuous support allowed me to attend the school for six months.</p>
<p class="bioside">Although it was a struggle, it has been one of the best experiences in my life. I
  am elated at the prospect of a career that will enable me to utilize my love of technology, and
 problem solving.</p>
 <p class="bioside"> Please feel free to review my portfolio, and my resume below.</p>
